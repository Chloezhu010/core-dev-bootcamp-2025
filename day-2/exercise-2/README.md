# 🎤 Show & Share: "One Thing I Didn't Know About rippled"

Students or teams will briefly present:

🔍 **"One Thing"** they didn't know before today — a function, pattern, transactor behavior, test case, data structure, or protocol detail.

🤔 **Why it stood out:** Was it confusing? Clever? Unexpected? Crucial for understanding XRPL?

🧠 **Their current understanding or questions about it.**

## 🌱 Purpose & Learning Value

- Promote a culture of inquiry and shared discovery
- Reinforce key takeaways from the deep-dive sessions on protocol, transactors, and tests
- Identify gaps in understanding to revisit in future sessions or 1:1s
- Help surface real developer pain points or "aha" moments

## ✅ Participation Format

- Quick 1–2 minute per student or team presentation
- Use diagrams, code snippets, or simple verbal explanations
- No need to be an expert — "I don't get why X happens in Y file" is perfectly valid

## 📘 Example Submissions

- "I didn't know that transactors inherit from a common base class that handles pre-checks."
- "I found a test case that mocks a ledger state and I still don't quite understand how it works."
- "I was surprised that the ApplyContext class touches so many components during a transaction."
