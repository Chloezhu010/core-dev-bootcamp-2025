## Consensus Overview

- The XRPL consensus process is implemented as a generic, template-based state machine ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- It enables distributed agreement on the next ledger state by collecting proposals from peers, tracking their positions, managing disputes, and determining when consensus is reached or failed.
- The process is parameterized by an Adaptor, allowing integration with different ledger and transaction set types ([RCLConsensus.h](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.h.txt)).
- The consensus engine manages transitions between phases, timing, peer proposals, and ledger application.

---

## Consensus Modes and Phases

### ConsensusMode

- Enumerates the operating mode of the local node in the consensus process ([ConsensusTypes.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt)):
  - `proposing`: Actively proposing positions.
  - `observing`: Observing but not proposing.
  - `wrongLedger`: Out of sync with the network's last closed ledger.
  - `switchedLedger`: Switched to a different ledger.
- String conversion provided by `to_string(ConsensusMode)`.

### ConsensusPhase

- Enumerates the current phase of the consensus round ([ConsensusTypes.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt)):
  - `open`: Ledger is open, collecting transactions.
  - `establish`: Proposals are exchanged, disputes resolved.
  - `accepted`: Consensus reached, ledger is closed and applied.
- String conversion provided by `to_string(ConsensusPhase)`.

---

## Consensus State and Result Types

### ConsensusState

- Enumerates possible consensus outcomes ([ConsensusTypes.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt)):
  - `No`: No consensus reached.
  - `MovedOn`: Network moved on without consensus.
  - `Expired`: Consensus process expired.
  - `Yes`: Consensus reached.

### ConsensusResult

- Template struct encapsulating the result of a consensus round ([ConsensusTypes.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt)):
  - `txns`: The transaction set agreed upon.
  - `position`: The local node's proposal.
  - `disputes`: Map of disputed transactions.
  - `compares`: Set of compared transaction sets.
  - `roundTime`: Timer for the round.
  - `state`: Current consensus state.
  - `proposers`: Number of proposers in the round.

---

## Consensus Parameters and Timing

### ConsensusParms

- Struct encapsulating configuration parameters for consensus ([ConsensusParms.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusParms.h.txt)):
  - Timeouts and intervals for validation and proposal freshness.
  - Minimum consensus percentages.
  - Ledger timing constraints.
  - Avalanche state machine settings.
- Example parameters:
  - `minCONSENSUS_PCT = 80`
  - `ledgerMIN_CONSENSUS = 1950ms`
  - `ledgerMAX_CONSENSUS = 15s`
  - `avalancheCutoffs`: Map of AvalancheState to cutoff thresholds.

### ConsensusTimer

- Utility class for timing consensus rounds ([ConsensusTypes.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusTypes.h.txt)):
  - `read()`: Returns elapsed time.
  - `tick()`: Advances timer.
  - `reset()`: Resets timer to a given time point.

### Avalanche State Machine

- Used to manage state transitions during consensus ([ConsensusParms.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusParms.h.txt)):
  - States: `init`, `mid`, `late`, `stuck`.
  - Each state has a consensus time and percentage cutoff.
  - `getNeededWeight()`: Determines required consensus percentage and next state.

---

## Consensus Lifecycle: State Machine and Phases

The consensus process is a state machine with three main phases ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)):

### Phase: open

- The ledger is open; new transactions are collected ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt), [app/ledger/README.md](src/xrpld/app/ledger/README.md)).
- The open ledger cannot close until consensus is reached on the previous ledger and either:
  - There is at least one transaction in the open ledger, or
  - The ledger's close time has been reached.
- When the open ledger is closed, its transactions become the initial proposal.

### Phase: establish

- Proposals are exchanged among peers ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- Disputes over transactions are resolved.
- The engine tracks peer positions, manages disputes, and updates the local proposal as needed.
- The phase continues until consensus is reached or the process expires.

### Phase: accepted

- Consensus has been reached or the process has expired ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- The agreed transaction set is applied to the ledger.
- The new ledger is built and validated.
- The process transitions to the next round.

---

## Proposal Handling and Peer Interaction

### ConsensusProposal

- Represents a proposal made by a node ([ConsensusProposal.h](src/xrpld/consensus/ConsensusProposal.h.txt)):
  - Includes previous ledger ID, proposal sequence, proposed position (e.g., transaction set hash), close time, and node ID.
  - Methods:
    - `isInitial()`, `isBowOut()`, `isStale()`: Proposal state checks.
    - `changePosition()`, `bowOut()`: Update proposal.
    - `signingHash()`: Compute signing hash for cryptographic purposes.
    - `getJson()`: Serialize to JSON.

### Peer Positions and Proposals

- Peer proposals are tracked in `currPeerPositions_` ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- Proposals are processed via `peerProposal()` and `peerProposalInternal()`.
- Proposals from dead nodes or for the wrong ledger are ignored.
- Only proposals with increasing sequence numbers are accepted.

### Proposal Playback and Dead Node Handling

- Recent peer positions are stored in `recentPeerPositions_` ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- Proposals can be replayed for new rounds via `playbackProposals()`.
- Dead nodes are tracked in `deadNodes_` and ignored in future rounds.

---

## Dispute Management

### DisputedTx

- Manages the state and voting for disputed transactions ([DisputedTx.h](src/xrpld/consensus/DisputedTx.h.txt)):
  - Tracks the transaction, local vote, and peer votes.
  - Methods:
    - `setVote()`, `unVote()`, `updateVote()`: Manage votes.
    - `stalled()`: Check if consensus is stalled on the transaction.
    - `getJson()`: Serialize dispute state.

### Dispute Creation and Update

- Disputes are created when comparing different transaction sets ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)):
  - `createDisputes()`: Compares local and peer sets, creates disputes for differences.
  - `updateDisputes()`: Updates votes for existing disputes.
- Disputes are updated each round based on peer positions and consensus parameters.

---

## Consensus Decision Logic

### shouldCloseLedger

- Determines if the current ledger should be closed ([Consensus.cpp](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.cpp.txt)):
  - Considers transaction activity, proposer participation, timing, and consensus parameters.

### checkConsensusReached

- Checks if a sufficient percentage of nodes have agreed on a proposal ([Consensus.cpp](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.cpp.txt)):
  - Considers edge cases like stalling or timeouts.
  - Returns true if consensus is reached.

### checkConsensus

- Orchestrates the consensus process ([Consensus.cpp](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.cpp.txt)):
  - Evaluates proposer counts, agreement levels, timing, and thresholds.
  - Returns the current consensus state (`No`, `Yes`, `MovedOn`, `Expired`).

---

## Consensus Round Progression

### startRound and startRoundInternal

- `startRound()` begins a new consensus round ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)):
  - Sets phase to `open`, initializes state, and records previous ledger.
  - Calls `startRoundInternal()` to set up the round.

### timerEntry and Phase Transitions

- `timerEntry()` is called periodically to advance the consensus process ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)):
  - Handles phase transitions (`open` → `establish` → `accepted`).
  - Calls `checkLedger()` to determine if the ledger should close or if consensus is reached.

### updateOurPositions and haveConsensus

- `updateOurPositions()` updates the local proposal based on peer input and disputes ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- `haveConsensus()` checks if consensus has been reached, based on the current state and parameters.

### closeLedger and onAccept

- `closeLedger()` transitions to the `establish` phase and creates the initial proposal ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- `onAccept()` (via the Adaptor) applies the agreed transaction set to the ledger, builds the new ledger, and notifies the application ([RCLConsensus.cpp](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.cpp.txt)).

---

## Adaptor Pattern and Integration

### RCLConsensus and Adaptor

- `RCLConsensus` implements the requirements of the generic `Consensus` class for the XRPL application ([RCLConsensus.h](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.h.txt)).
- The Adaptor provides methods for:
  - Acquiring ledgers and transaction sets.
  - Sharing proposals and transactions with peers.
  - Proposing new ledgers.
  - Managing open transactions and consensus parameters.
  - Handling mode changes and ledger building.

### Ledger and Transaction Set Integration

- The consensus engine operates on generic ledger and transaction set types, provided by the Adaptor ([RCLConsensus.h](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.h.txt)).
- Transaction sets are represented as `SHAMap` structures ([app/consensus/README.md](src/xrpld/app/consensus/README.md)).
- Ledgers are built by applying the agreed transaction set to the previous ledger ([app/ledger/README.md](src/xrpld/app/ledger/README.md)).

---

## Consensus Logging and Monitoring

- Detailed logging is integrated throughout the consensus process ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt), [RCLConsensus.cpp](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.cpp.txt)):
  - Logs phase transitions, proposal changes, disputes, and consensus decisions.
  - `RclConsensusLogger` records timing and events for each round ([RCLConsensus.h](src/xrpld/app/consensus/RCLConsensus.h.txt)).
- Consensus state and progress can be serialized to JSON for monitoring and debugging ([Consensus.h](src/xrpld/consensus/Consensus.h.txt)).
- The `doConsensusInfo` RPC handler provides consensus information to clients ([ConsensusInfo.cpp](src/xrpld/rpc/handlers/ConsensusInfo.cpp.txt)).

---
