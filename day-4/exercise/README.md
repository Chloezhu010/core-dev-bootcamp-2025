# XRPL Cryptography Deep Dive: Transaction Signing & Verification

## üéØ Exercise Overview

This exercise will guide you through the XRPL (XRP Ledger) codebase to understand how transactions are cryptographically signed and verified. You'll explore the core security mechanisms that protect the network from fraudulent transactions.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the transaction signature verification pipeline
- Identify cryptographic methods used in XRPL
- Trace public key validation flows
- Explore multi-signature implementation
- Analyze security measures against replay attacks

## üîç Quest Tasks

### Task 1: Signature Verification Discovery
**Objective**: Find where rippled verifies transaction signatures

**Steps**:
1. Start your investigation at `Transactor::apply()` in `src/ripple/app/tx/impl/Transactor.cpp`
2. Follow the call chain through `preflight()` and `checkSign()`
3. Identify the core verification function

**Questions to Answer**:
- Which function performs the actual signature check?
- What cryptographic method is used (ed25519, secp256k1, or both)?
- How does the system handle different signature algorithms?

> **Note:**  
> - `Transactor::checkSign()` is responsible for verifying ledger permissions, such as checking for the use of a `RegularKey` or a `SignerList` (multi-signature).  
> - `STTx::checkSign()` performs the actual cryptographic signature verification.  
> - The function `checkValidity` is also involved in checking the validity of the transaction and its signatures.

### Task 2: Public Key Flow Analysis
**Objective**: Trace how public keys are retrieved and validated

**Investigation Points**:
- How does the network retrieve the public key for a signing account?
- Where is the public key stored in the ledger?
- What validation steps ensure the public key is legitimate?

**Files to Examine**:
- `src/ripple/protocol/STTx.cpp`
- Account object handling in ledger code
- Public key extraction logic

### Task 3: Multi-Signature Deep Dive
**Objective**: Understand multi-signature implementation

**Research Areas**:
- Where is multisig logic implemented?
- How does the verification process change for multi-signed transactions?
- What are the requirements for valid multi-signature combinations?

**Key Questions**:
- How many signatures are required vs. how many are provided?
- How does the system handle partial signature verification?
- What happens when signature thresholds aren't met?

### Task 4: Security Mechanisms (Bonus Challenge)
**Objective**: Identify anti-fraud measures

**Security Analysis**:
- How does the network prevent signature reuse (replay attacks)?
- What mechanisms detect forged signatures?
- How are sequence numbers used in signature validation?

**Advanced Challenge**:
- Design a modification to support post-quantum signature schemes
- Consider backward compatibility and migration strategies
- Identify performance implications
